# SIVUSCG-Writeups

Welcome to my writeups from the US Cyber Games!

This past week, I have had the opportunity to participate in both the US Cyber Open CTF and the Beginner's Game Room for the US Cyber Games. I had a lot of fun and ended up placing 19th with 8503 points, combined between the two competitions. 5203 of these were from the Open, placing me in 24th excluding the Beginner's Game Room.

This repository contains writeups for all the challenges I completed in the Open, including 2 for Reverse Engineering, 5 for Web, 7 for Forensics, 2 for Crypto, and 2 for Misc. I also completed 22 challenges for the Beginner's Game Room, which I might add writeups for here later.

Thank you so much again to everyone who helped host this competition and create challenges, it was a lot of fun and I definitely feel as though I learned a lot!
